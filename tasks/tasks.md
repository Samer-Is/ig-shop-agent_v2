## Development Guidelines

### Code Review Requirements
- [ ] All code must pass automated tests
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Minimum 80% test coverage for new features
- [ ] Security review for authentication/authorization code
- [ ] Performance impact assessment for database operations

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature implemented according to acceptance criteria
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Risk Management
**Identified Risks**:
1. **Azure Service Limits**: Monitor quotas and scaling requirements
2. **Instagram API Changes**: Keep up with Meta API updates and deprecations
3. **OpenAI Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and fallback mechanisms
4. **Data Privacy**: Ensure GDPR compliance from the start

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Regular Azure cost and usage monitoring
- Subscribe to Meta developer updates
- Implement circuit breakers for external APIs
- Privacy-by-design architecture implementation
